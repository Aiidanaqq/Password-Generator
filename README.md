1.Header Inclusions:
#include <iostream>: Includes the input/output stream library for handling input and output operations.
#include <string>: Includes the string library for string manipulation.
#include <random>: Includes the random library for generating random numbers.

2.Namespace Declaration:
using namespace std;: Declares that the program will use the std namespace, which includes standard C++ library functions and objects.

3.Function Definitions:
generatePassword: Generates a random password based on user-defined criteria such as length and character types (letters, digits, symbols).
evaluatePasswordStrength: Evaluates the strength of a password based on its length.

4.Main Function:
Prompts the user to input the minimum and maximum password lengths, and whether to include letters, digits, and symbols.
Calls the generatePassword function to create a password based on the user's input.
Calls the evaluatePasswordStrength function to determine the strength of the generated password.
Prints the generated password and its strength.

5.Password Generation:
Constructs a character set based on user preferences for including letters, digits, and symbols.
Uses random number generation to create passwords of random length within the specified range and from the constructed character set.

6.Password Strength Evaluation:
Classifies the strength of a password as "Very High", "High", or "Low" based on its length.

7.Random Number Generation:
Initializes random number generators and distributions using the <random> library.

8.Input/Output:
The program interacts with the user through the console, prompting for input and displaying the generated password and its strength.
